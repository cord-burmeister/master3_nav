      # http://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d
      # Inflation is the process of propagating cost values out from occupied cells that decrease with distance.
      #  For this purpose, we define 5 specific symbols for costmap values as they relate to a robot.      
      # "Lethal" cost means that there is an actual (workspace) obstacle in a cell. So if the robot's center were in that cell, 
      # the robot would obviously be in collision.
      # "Inscribed" cost means that a cell is less than the robot's inscribed radius away from an actual obstacle. 
      # So the robot is certainly in collision with some obstacle if the robot center is in a cell that is at or above the inscribed cost.
      # "Possibly circumscribed" cost is similar to "inscribed", but using the robot's circumscribed radius as cutoff distance. 
      # Thus, if the robot center lies in a cell at or above this value, then it depends on the orientation of the robot whether it 
      # collides with an obstacle or not. We use the term "possibly" because it might be that it is not really an obstacle cell, 
      # but some user-preference, that put that particular cost value into the map. For example, if a user wants to express that a robot 
      # should attempt to avoid a particular area of a building, they may inset their own costs into the costmap for that region 
      # independent of any obstacles. Note, that although the value is 128 is used as an example in the diagram above, the true value 
      # is influenced by both the inscribed_radius and inflation_radius parameters as defined in the code.
      # "Freespace" cost is assumed to be zero, and it means that there is nothing that should keep the robot from going there.
      # "Unknown" cost means there is no information about a given cell. The user of the costmap can interpret this as they see fit.
      # All other costs are assigned a value between "Freespace" and "Possibly circumscribed" depending on their distance from a "Lethal" 
      # cell and the decay function provided by the user.
      # The rationale behind these definitions is that we leave it up to planner implementations to care or not about the exact footprint, 
      # yet give them enough information that they can incur the cost of tracing out the footprint only in situations where the orientation actually matters.

        # A higher cost_scaling_factor results in a steeper gradient, meaning the cost values drop off more rapidly from the obstacle12.
        # A scaling factor to apply to cost values during inflation. The cost function is computed as follows for all cells in the costmap 
        # further than the inscribed radius distance and closer than the inflation radius distance away from an actual obstacle: 
        # exp(-1.0 * cost_scaling_factor * (distance_from_obstacle - inscribed_radius)) * (costmap_2d::INSCRIBED_INFLATED_OBSTACLE - 1),

      # In the Rviz screenshot there are small grey pixels under the laser scan markings which means the obstacle_layer is doing things.
      # To inflate the obstacle_layer detections (and voxel_layer which you might want to do as well) you have to move the

#In general though, the following table is a good guide for the optimal planning plugin for different types of robot bases:
# Plugin Name                 Supported Robot Types
# NavFn Planner               Circular Differential, Circular Omnidirectional
# Smac Planner 2D             Circular Differential, Circular Omnidirectional
# Theta Star Planner          Circular Differential, Circular Omnidirectional
# Smac Hybrid-A* Planner      Non-circular or Circular Ackermann, Non-circular or Circular Legged
# Smac Lattice Planner        Non-circular Differential, Non-circular Omnidirectional, Arbitrary
# Since the planning problem is primarily driven by the robot type, the table accurately summarizes the advice to users 
# by the maintainers. Within the circular robot regime, the choice of planning algorithm is dependent on application and desirable behavior. 
# NavFn will typically make broad, sweeping curves; Theta* prefers straight lines and supports them at any angle; 
# and Smac 2D is essentially a classical A* algorithm with cost-aware penalties.
# The NavfnPlanner is a global planner plugin for the Nav2 Planner server. It implements the Navigation Function
#  planner with either A* or Dij. expansions. It is largely equivalent to its counterpart in ROS 1 Navigation. 
# The Navfn planner assumes a circular robot (or a robot that can be approximated as circular for the purposes 
# of global path planning) and operates on a weighted costmap.

      #   Wavefront Expansion: Dijkstra’s algorithm expands nodes in all directions uniformly, creating a wavefront from the start node.
      #   Optimality: It guarantees finding the shortest path in terms of cost from the start to the goal node.
      #   Speed: It can be slower because it explores all possible paths to ensure the shortest one is found.
      #   Use Case: Best for scenarios where the cost of traversing each edge is the same or when you need the absolute shortest path.
      # A* Algorithm
      #   Heuristic Expansion: A* uses a heuristic to guide its search, prioritizing nodes that are closer to the goal.
      #   Optimality: It also guarantees the shortest path, but only if the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the cost to reach the goal).
      #   Speed: Generally faster than Dijkstra’s because it uses the heuristic to focus the search, reducing the number of nodes expanded.
      #   Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where you need faster pathfinding and can use a heuristic to estimate the cost to the goal.
